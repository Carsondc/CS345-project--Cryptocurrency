    "## * Detailed description of the dataset\n",
    "The dataset we used is Crypto currencies daily prices by Steven Van Ingelem which is publically available on kaggle.com . The data set contains csv files for 97 crypto currencies. Each csv file contains historical data for each currency going back to shortly after each currency's inception. The csv file for each currency is updated daily. Each currency has its own csv file and each csv file contains six columns. Ticker, Date, open, high, low, and close. The dataset is free to use and also includes a free api with no restrictions on the number of times in can be called. The code for the API is provided on the kaggle website. The api uses kagglehub.load_dataset to automatically process each csv file as a pandas dataframe Using the API required importing the Kaggle DatasetAdapter from the Kaggle Hub library. Here is a link to the data set. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/svaningelgem/crypto-currencies-daily-prices/data\n",
